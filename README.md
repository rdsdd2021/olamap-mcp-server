 üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Connection closed" Error
- **Cause**: Missing or invalid API key
- **Solution**: Ensure `OLAMAP_API_KEY` environment variable is set with a valid key

#### Windows NPX Permission Issues
- **Cause**: Windows file permission problems with npm cache
- **Solutions**:
  1. Use global installation: `npm install -g olamap-mcp-server@latest`
  2. Use node directly: `node /path/to/dist/index.js`
  3. Run as administrator

#### Module Not Found Errors
- **Cause**: Package installation issues
- **Solution**: Clear npm cache and reinstall:
  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  npx -y olamap-mcp-server@latest
  ```

#### TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Cause**: Missing TypeScript during installation
- **Solution**: Use the published package instead of building from source

### Testing Your Installation

```bash
# Test with a simple API key
OLAMAP_API_KEY=your_key npx -y olamap-mcp-server@latest

# Should output: "OlaMap MCP Server running on stdio"
```

### Supported Platforms

- **Node.js**: 18.0.0 or higher
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux
