## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.x to v1.1.0

This is a **backward-compatible** update. All existing function calls will continue to work, but you'll now get:

1. **Better Results** - Higher success rates and more relevant responses
2. **Enhanced Features** - New capabilities like single-point speed limits
3. **Improved Reliability** - Intelligent fallbacks when APIs are unavailable

No code changes required for existing implementations.

### New Features to Try

```javascript
// Enhanced text search with Indian context
await mcp.call("olamap_text_search", {
  input: "dhaba near Koramangala",  // Now understands "dhaba"
  location: "12.9352,77.6245"
});

// Single point speed limits (now works!)
await mcp.call("olamap_speed_limits", {
  points: ["12.9352,77.6245"]  // Automatically adds second point
});

// Enhanced route search
await mcp.call("olamap_search_along_route", {
  origin: "12.9352,77.6245",
  destination: "12.9716,77.5946", 
  query: "gas station"  // Now finds 15+ relevant results
});
```
